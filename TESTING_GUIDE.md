If you have the apk file please follow the below instructions to test the app
- Open the "File Manager" or "Downloads" app on your Android device.
- Locate the APK file you want to install. By default, downloaded files are usually stored in the "Downloads" folder, but you may have   saved it in a different location.
- Tap on the APK file to initiate the installation process. A prompt may appear asking for your confirmation to install applications from unknown sources. Android devices usually prevent the installation of apps from sources other than the Google Play Store as a security measure.
- If the prompt appears, you need to enable the "Unknown Sources" option. Tap on "Settings" when prompted, and it will take you to the relevant settings page. Alternatively, you can manually navigate to the settings on your device and search for "Unknown Sources" or "Install unknown apps." Enable the option for the file manager or web browser you're using to access the APK file.
- Once the "Unknown Sources" option is enabled, go back to the APK file and tap on it again. This time, the installation process should begin.
- You may be asked to review the app permissions before proceeding with the installation. Read through them and tap on the "Install" button to continue.
- The installation process will take a few moments, and once it's complete, you'll see an "App installed" or similar message.
- You can then open the app directly from the installation screen or find it on your device's app drawer.
